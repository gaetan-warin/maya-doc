## Overview

This documentation suite provides the authoritative reference for the **Maya Scheduling & Task Management** module. It is designed to serve as a single source of truth for Product Owners, Architects, and Development Teams.

The suite follows an enterprise-standard structure, separating **Business Logic** (What) from **Technical Implementation** (How) and providing a clear **Migration Path** from the current legacy state to the target architecture.

## How to Use This Suite

### For Product Owners
Start with **`01_FunctionalSpecification.md`**. This document describes the business rules, user capabilities, and use cases without technical jargon. Use it to validate that any proposed changes do not violate core business logic.

### For Developers (New to Project)
Read the documents in order:
1.  **`01_FunctionalSpecification.md`** — Understand the domain.
2.  **`02_TechnicalAudit_ASIS.md`** — Understand the current implementation and its known pitfalls.
3.  **`05_APIContractSpecification.md`** — Reference for specific endpoint behaviors.

### For Architects / Tech Leads
Focus on:
1.  **`03_TechnicalDesign_TOBE.md`** — The target unified task model.
2.  **`04_MigrationPlaybook.md`** — The phased approach to transition.

## Key Concepts (Quick Reference)

| Concept | Definition |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Tenant** | The customer organization (UI/API layer). |
| **Group** | The operational unit / site (Database layer). One Tenant → Many Groups. |
| **Task Cluster** | A logical "Job" represented by multiple DB rows linked by `merge_key`. |
| **Merge Key** | A long string generated by the frontend to group task rows. **Critical Dependency.** |
| **Model 2** | The current (AS-IS) architecture with separate `task` and `spraying` tables. |
| **Model 3** | The target (TO-BE) unified architecture with a single `tasks` table and junction tables. |

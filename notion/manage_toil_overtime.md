Keeping track of TOIL (Time Off in Lieu) and Overtime is essential to ensure fair compensation and accurate time management. Similar to managing absences, you can record and monitor TOIL and Overtime in two ways: through the Schedule page or directly from the Team Management page. Here’s how to do it.

## Method 1: Adding TOIL and Overtime from the Team Management Page

1.  **Navigate to the Team Management Page**
    Head to Team Management from your main dashboard.
2.  **Click the “+” Button**
    In the top section of the page, click the “+” button to add a new entry.
3.  **Select TOIL or Overtime**
    Choose whether you’re recording TOIL or Overtime from the type dropdown.
4.  **Enter Details**
    Select the staff member, date, start and end time, and add any relevant comments.
5.  **Save the Entry**
    Once saved, the TOIL or Overtime entry will be added to the member’s profile and can be visualized in the bottom part of the page.

This method is ideal if you need to update multiple entries quickly, allowing you to record both TOIL and Overtime without switching pages.

## Method 2: Adding TOIL and Overtime from the Schedule Page

### For TOIL:
*   **Select the TOIL Icon**: In the Schedule page, click on the TOIL icon to add TOIL for a specific team member.
*   **Record TOIL**: This entry will be saved directly in the system, making it easy to log TOIL on the go.

> A callout display on the Schedule page is under development, and you will soon be able to visually see who has TOIL for the day, making it even easier to track at a glance from the schedule page and the digital whiteboard.. just bear with us another few weeks !

### For Overtime:
*   **Click on the Overtime Button**: When a task requires extra hours, click the Overtime button to log the additional hours completed by a team member.
*   **Visual Confirmation**: Once logged, the icon turns red to confirm the overtime entry has been recorded.
*   **Editing or Deleting Entries**: If you need to edit or delete overtime, go back to the Team Management page, where you can easily make adjustments.

## Viewing TOIL and Overtime in Team Management

In the Team Management page, TOIL and Overtime entries are displayed within the “Hours” view, giving you a clear, colour-coded representation.

This helps you manage TOIL and Overtime hours efficiently, ensuring your team is compensated fairly and that there’s a record of all time adjustments.

With these easy methods, you have full control over TOIL and Overtime, allowing you to keep track of extra hours and ensure that time off balances are accurate.

# 8. Nutritional Inputs

With this tool you will be able to:
*   See nutrient levels on charts
*   Filter nutrients by area, hole and year
*   Manage treatments and fertilisations, including “Spraying Routines”
*   See the current nutrient levels
*   See planned fertilisation tasks, validate or postpone them

## Step by step:
1.  **Understanding the Different Modes of the Nutritional Input Page**
    *   Standard Mode
    *   Advanced Spraying Mode
    *   Precision Mode
2.  Add a treatment
3.  Add a Spraying Routine
4.  Visualise the nutrients
5.  Validate or postpone a planned Nutritional Input

# Understanding the Different Modes of the Nutritional Input Page

1.  Standard Mode
2.  Advanced Spraying Mode
3.  Precision Management Advanced Mode

## 1. Standard Mode
The Standard Mode is straightforward, providing the essential inputs needed for basic nutrient application. In this mode, you can enter:
*   **Product Quantity per Hectare**: The amount of product (e.g., fertiliser) you wish to apply per hectare.
*   **Total Quantity**: The total amount needed for the selected area.

This mode is perfect for users who only require fundamental details, making it easy to apply and monitor nutrient levels with minimal setup.

## 2. Advanced Spraying Mode
The Advanced Spraying Mode allows for more in-depth operational control by including several additional parameters for spraying. In this mode, you can configure:
*   **Flow Rate (LPM)**, **Tractor Speed (KM/H)**, and **Revolutions per Minute (RPM)** to align with your equipment settings.
*   **Dissolution Volume per Hectare** and **Dissolution Volume per Tank** for precise measurement.

Based on these inputs, Maya calculates and gives you:
*   **Total Dissolution Volume** required for the entire area.
*   **Number of Tanks** needed to cover the selected area.
*   **Recommended Flow Rate** to help you select the appropriate nozzle or sprayer settings.
*   **Nitrogen Unit Quantity** for each product, allowing you to monitor the nitrogen applied based on the entered quantities.

These calculations are automated, so users simply enter their application rate, tractor speed and tank details, and the system provides accurate guidance on the setup required to meet the application goals. This mode is ideal for those who want a balance between precision and ease of use.

## 3. Precision Management Advanced Mode
The Precision Management Advanced Mode builds on the Advanced Spraying Mode with additional settings to fine-tune nutrient application even further. In this mode, you can specify:
*   **Nozzle Type** and **Nozzle Spacing** between nozzles to achieve optimal coverage, which you can customise in Settings.

Maya will then also calculates the associated **Nozzle Flow Rate** based on your input parameters, ensuring your equipment is optimally set up for the desired application rate.

Additionally, this mode calculates **live nitrogen units** based on the entered product quantities, helping you monitor nitrogen applications with accuracy. This advanced mode is perfect for users seeking the highest level of precision in nutrient application management.
